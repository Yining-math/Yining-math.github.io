## Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Yining Chen currently a master student of mathematics in the University of Bonn supervised by [Prof. Gaitsgory](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gaitsgde/index.html). You can also find some information in my [Zhihu page](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ruo-ru-12-16) (a Chinese cummunity) where I write some posts about mathematics. But note that it's in Chinese.

## Interests
I'm interested in derived algebraic geometry and its interactions with other fields. Now I'm supervised by [Prof. Gaitsgory](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gaitsgde/index.html) to learn how derived algebraic geometry paves the way for geometric Langlands program.
